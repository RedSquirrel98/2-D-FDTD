# 2-D-FDTD
2-D FDTD customizable simulation for electromagnetics
This simulation is great for visualizing optical phenomena such as refraction, diffraction, and reflection. Specify a 2-D object and customize its 
material parameters (permittivity, permeability, conductivity) to simulate a variety of dielectric, magnetic, or metallic objects.

This simulation implements the Finite-Difference-Time Domain method as created by Kane Yee. This is a bare-bones FDTD simulator that relies heavily on
the user's knowledge of electromagnetics, since nearly every step must be customized from the default settings. However, I have included helpful 
comments that should guide you through the set-up process.

For more information on the FDTD method, see the book Computational Electromagnetics by Taflove.
